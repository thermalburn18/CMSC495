Project Description:

The main goal of the program is to provide an interface for employees to use to record the time that they start and end their shifts, and for management to audit the times against a preset schedule. The system provides an all-in-one approach to time management, mitigating the need for fragmentation or ad-hoc integration of multiple systems. As far as the end-user interaction goes, it's as simple as possible. The system requirements for the end user are reliability, security and ease of interaction. The system needs to accept a valid input unilaterally and record the information as required without failure or interruption providing security at each level of usage.
