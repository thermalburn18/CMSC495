This folder holds working code for the development of the Employee Time Management System.  The code here can login to the MySQL server using
the Java client program using SSL to encrypt the conection. There is also code that allows for the digital signature of timesheets to be
created using a users private key, and verifing the signature using the users public key.  Currently this is writen and read to a file 
until the database schema is ready to be used.
