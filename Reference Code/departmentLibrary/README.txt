I deleted all the files in this folder, because I added the new and working full program

Ignore this folder. If possible someone please delete.

This is just a simple program that shows how the servlet calls the javascript file. 

I've annotated the files with some comments. 

Please note that the code DOES NOT RUN. This because this is just a snippit of a larger program, and because we
do not have a server set up. When I get the server up and running I will upload the whole program for reference.

In the mean time, hopefully this helps you guys see the MVC architecture and the seperation between the
model (java object), view (jsp page), and control (java servlet).
