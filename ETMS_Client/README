This is a combination of the GUI/Web stuff Elvin was working on and the Java/DB stuff Justin was working on.

Other files required for testing can be grabbed from the CMSC495/testing/ directory.
You will need:
Apache Taglibs Libraries
Certificates and keys (for DB, and Apache)
Apache server.xml (update line for keystore path for your system)
etms.cfg
cert.cfg
A my.ini file setup to utilize ssl keys

The ETMS database is also required
